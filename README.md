You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.
Instructions:

Create a file named basic_operations.py.
In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].
